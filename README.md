In the analysis folder, running "gut passage time.R" and "movement.R" will pull in data from the "data" folder, run Bayesian analyses, and save predictions as .RData objects. The .RData objects used to produce figures have been saved in the analysis folder.

Run the "seed dispersal distances.R" code to develop predicted dispersal distances and produce figures. Can run this without running the models, pulling in predicted gut passage times and displacement values from the two .RData objects within the "analysis" folder.

The Bayesian analyses use JAGS, which needs to be installed before the code will run.
